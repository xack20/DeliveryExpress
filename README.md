## Features

2.	Users can quote any service after choosing one, they can add a request for their desired service.
3.	Admins can review user’s quotes and accept/reject that.
4.	Users can track their products during the shipment.
5.	Admin can update the product status.



This delivery system will be really helpful for people to shift their products from one location to anther location without going to any service providers office and bidding a huge crowd sometimes. Also, some pandemic situation like recent days it is really a useful service for everyone. As it will be a decentralized system so there will not be any issue like data loss/leak.

Users can choose any service (shipping/courier), they can see the full details of any services before making any quote about the pricing and other stuffs. Admin of the system can review the service request created by users, and can accept/reject requests based on scenarios. Admin and user can contact with each other for any kind of query from any end.

Users need to fill some certain fields before making any quote/request for any service for an uninterrupted delivery. They can also track their products during the shipment, 

Admins will surely update the products location and status during the shipment by which users can track their products anytime.
